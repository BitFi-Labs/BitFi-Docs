# BitFi Docs

This repository hosts the BitFi documentation powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) using the classic TypeScript preset. All existing GitBook content lives under `docs/` with the original structure preserved.

## Getting started

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start local dev server: `npm start` (runs at http://localhost:3000)
- Build static site: `npm run build`

## Deployment

The site builds to the `build/` directory. The output is static and ready for platforms such as Vercel—configure the project to run `npm install` then `npm run build`, and set the output directory to `build`.
